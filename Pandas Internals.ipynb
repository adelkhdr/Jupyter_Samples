    "# 1: Data Structures\n",
    "In this mission and the next, we're going to dive into some of Pandas' internals to better understand how Pandas does things under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three key data structures in Pandas are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Series (collection of values)\n",
    "* DataFrame (collection of Series objects)\n",
    "* Panel (collection of DataFrame objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "and we'll be focusing on the Series object in this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series objects use NumPy arrays for fast computation, but build on them by adding valuable features for analyzing data. For example, while NumPy arrays utilize an integer index, Series objects can utilize other index types, like a string index. Series objects also allow for mixed data types and utilize the NaN Python value for handling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series object can hold many data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* float - for representing float values\n",
    "* int - for representing integer values\n",
    "* bool - for representing Boolean values\n",
    "* datetime64[ns] - for representing date & time, without time-zone\n",
    "* datetime64[ns, tz] - for representing date & time, with time-zone\n",
    "* timedelta[ns] - for representing differences in dates & times (seconds, minutes, etc.)\n",
    "* category - for representing categorical values\n",
    "* object - for representing String values\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive further, let's introduce the dataset we'll be working with. The FiveThirtyEight team recently released a dataset containing the critics scores for all movies that have substantive user and critic reviews from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Fandango. We'll be working with the file fandango_score_comparison.csv, which you can download from their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). Here are some of the columns in the dataset:\n"

    "DataFrames use Series objects to represent the columns in the data. When you select a single column from a DataFrame, Pandas will return the Series object representing that column. Each individual Series object in a DataFrame is indexed using the integer data type by default. Each value in the Series has a unique integer index, or position. The integer index is 0-indexed, like most Python data structures, and ranges from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of rows. With an integer index, you can select an individual value in the Series if you know it's position as well as select multiple values by passing in a list of index values (similar to a NumPy array).\n",
